# Drift bottle on chain

- Is there something you've always wanted to say but never had the courage to? What are you afraid of? What’s holding you back? Send out a drift bottle and let out the words in your heart.
- Is there someone you can’t stop thinking about, someone you want to say something to but don’t dare? Write it down in a drift bottle, and maybe it will find its way to their heart…
- Has anyone ever told you, “I love you so much”...
- Are you feeling overwhelmed? Need a place to vent? Write down the worries in your heart and send them far away.
- Did you know? That year, I waited for you until the very end...
